Today, almost seven billion people live all over           Earth! People have changed our planet in many ways.","What Have People Changed?      Some places on Earth haven't changed very much. They are      natural areas, like rainforests and national parks. Natural      areas are important because they are homes for many plants      and animals. We need to care for these areas so that plants      and animals can live there in the future.","In other areas, people have changed many things. In rural      areas, farmers have cut down trees and they have cleared land      to grow crops for people to eat. In urban areas, like towns      and cities, people have built lots of homes and other buildings.     They have also built roads, bridges, and tunnels.","What Have People Changed?      Earth gives us lots of resources like food and other      products from plants and animals. It also gives us water to      drink and air to breathe.","These natural resources are renewable - they replace        themselves naturally. We can get more of these resources,        but we need to share them with other people.","In some parts of the world, people don't have enough food       or enough clean water. Earth also gives us mineral resources,      like metals, that we use to make products in factories.","We burn fossil fuels, like oil, coal, and gas, to produce       energy. These resources are non-renewable. We can't get any      more, so we need to use them carefully.","Waste and Pollution       We throwaway too much waste, and this is bad for our       planet. We need to reduce the amount of waste that we       produce - we can recycle more things, like paper, plastic,       glass, and metal.","Our cars and factories produce smoke that pollutes the air.       In some cities, it can be difficult to breathe because there's      so much pollution in the air. Some factories pollute our       water and soil. We should build more modern factories that       don't produce so much pollution.","Global Warming       Scientists think that a new greenhouse period is starting.       Earth is getting warmer, and many glaciers are melting, like       the ones on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Why is this       happening? For the last 150 years, people have burned lots      of fossil fuels, and this makes gases like carbon dioxide.","The carbon dioxide is increasing the natural greenhouse       effect, and making Earth warmer. This is called global       warming. We need to produce less carbon dioxide. We also      need to protect our forests and plant new trees. Trees use       carbon dioxide and slow down global warming.","Caring for Our Planet      We live on a beautiful planet that has been here for billions       of years. Earth gives us everything that we need to live.       Now we need to care for our planel so that our children       and our grandchildren can enjoy It in the future, too!","","Quiz Time"];
